<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviat
    ed as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly ty
    ped, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpr
    eted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaSc
    ript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide W
    b content production. It is used to make webpages interactiv
    e and provide online programs, including video games. The majorit
    y of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it with
    ch of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of
     JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines 
     ot supporting the spec 
    fully, and with many engines supporting 
    additional features beyond ECMA.
